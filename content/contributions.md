# Call for Contributions
**The call for contributions is closed.**

## Workshop scope
The ISWC2019 workshop on Decentralizing the Semantic Web
welcomes novel contributions on intelligent clients,
decentralized applications, and enabling technologies.
Consult the [detailed topic list](/topics/)
or [last year’s contributions](http://iswc2017.desemweb.org/)
for inspiration.

You can share three kinds of contributions:
[research articles](#research-articles),
[decentralized applications](#decentralized-applications),
and [vision statements](#vision-statements).
Share your work with us _before **1 June 2019**_
through the [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=swsa.semanticweb.org/ISWC/2019/Workshop/DeSemWeb) platform.

### Research articles
{:#research-articles}
DeSemWeb research articles provide _creative solutions to problems_
in the domain of intelligent clients, decentralized applications,
and/or enabling technologies,
covering one or more of the workshop’s [topics](/topics/).

Research articles bring _scientifically motivated insights_ and should:

{:.inline}
- clearly state the tackled problem upfront in the abstract and introduction
- explain the differences with related work
- evaluate the contribution
  through a prototype, use case, or experiments

We recommend to target 6,000–8,000 words (12–16 pages).
[Send your article.](https://openreview.net/group?id=swsa.semanticweb.org/ISWC/2019/Workshop/DeSemWeb)

### Decentralized applications
{:#decentralized-applications}
Create an _application using decentralized technologies_,
and describe how it was built,
emphasizing the importance of decentralization
and the necessity of Semantic Web or Linked Data.
We especially welcome applications
built on top of the [Solid](https://solid.mit.edu/) platform
for decentralized Linked Data applications.

[Share a link to your demonstration or video](https://openreview.net/group?id=swsa.semanticweb.org/ISWC/2019/Workshop/DeSemWeb),
accompanied by a description of around 1,000–4,000 words (2–8 pages).

### Vision statements
{:#vision-statements}
Share _your vision for the future_ of the Semantic Web,
with a focus on clients and/or decentralization,
addressing current issues, relevant questions, future directions, …
Does the Semantic Web need decentralization—and
does decentralization need the Semantic Web?
Contributions on any of the [topics](/topics/) are welcome.

We recommend to target 1,000–4,000 words (2–8 pages).
[Send your vision statement.](https://openreview.net/group?id=swsa.semanticweb.org/ISWC/2019/Workshop/DeSemWeb)


## Author guidelines

### Format
Authors can choose the best way to express their work,
such as HTML or PDF.
Given the scope of the workshop,
we encourage the usage of native Web technologies
and especially welcome HTML contributions with semantic annotations.
Authors looking for practical advice might find the
[HTML guide](http://iswc2019.semanticweb.org/calls/html-submission-guide/) helpful.

The DeSemWeb workshop series endorses the
[Linked Research](https://linkedresearch.org/) principles.
You might like to check its various aspects
(unique identifiers, resources, feedback, …)
and try to apply relevant ones to your contribution.

### Review process
Please share your DeSemWeb contribution before the deadline
through the [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=swsa.semanticweb.org/ISWC/2019/Workshop/DeSemWeb) peer review platform.

You can—and are encouraged to—publish your contribution on the Web
while it is under review.

### Publication
Accepted contributions will be published as [CEUR-WS](http://ceur-ws.org/) proceedings
and need to be presented by one of the authors at the workshop.
