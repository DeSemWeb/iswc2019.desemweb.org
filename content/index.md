# A workshop that focuses on _clients_

## Purpose and scope
Like the Web,
the Semantic Web is often reduced to a centralized story:
we rely on large-scale server-side infrastructures
to perform intense reasoning, data mining, query execution, etc.
Therefore, we urgently need research and engineering
to _put the “Web” back in the “Semantic Web”_,
aiming for **intelligent clients** instead of intelligent servers.
The DeSemWeb2018 workshop focuses on **decentralized and client-side applications**
to counterbalance the centralized discourse of other tracks.
While we recognize the value in all subfields of the Semantic Web,
we see an urgent need to _revalue the role of clients_,
continuing [last year’s edition](http://iswc2017.desemweb.org/).

[Contribute to this workshop](/contributions/) and help put different topics on the Semantic Web community’s research agenda,
which will lead to new inspiration and initiatives
to build future Semantic Web and Linked Data applications.

> Decentralization changes the perspective
> for Semantic Web technologies,
> and increases the scale at which we need to apply them.
