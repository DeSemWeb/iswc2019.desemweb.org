# A workshop that focuses on _clients_

## Purpose and scope
Like the Web,
the Semantic Web is often reduced to a centralized story:
we rely on large-scale server-side infrastructures
to perform intense reasoning, data mining, query execution, etc.
Therefore, we urgently need research and engineering
to _put the “Web” back in the “Semantic Web”_,
aiming for **intelligent clients** instead of intelligent servers.
The DeSemWeb2019 workshop focuses on **decentralized and client-side applications**
to counterbalance the centralized discourse of other tracks.
While we recognize the value in all subfields of the Semantic Web,
we see an urgent need to _revalue the role of clients_,
continuing [last year’s edition](http://iswc2018.desemweb.org/).

Contribute to this workshop
and help put different topics on the Semantic Web community’s research agenda,
which will lead to new inspiration and initiatives
to build future Semantic Web and Linked Data applications.

> Decentralization changes the perspective
> for Semantic Web technologies,
> and increases the scale at which we need to apply them.
